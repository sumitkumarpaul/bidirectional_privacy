# XMLRSS - A Java Crypto Provider for Redactable Signatures

## Sumit:
Compilation command:  reset;./gradlew build;cp build/libs/xmlrss-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar .
Note: Compilation environment is present within the local VM of the laptop PC only
If required, compile in that environment and use the compiled jar file elsewhere.

Currently, xmlrss implements three redactable signature algorithms:

* PSRSS (based on "On Updatable Redactable Signatures" by Pöhls and Samelin)
* GSRSS (the general construction for sets, based on "A General Framework for Redactable Signatures and New
  Constructions" by Derler et al.)
* GLRSS (the general construction for lists, based on "A General Framework for Redactable Signatures and New
  Constructions" by Derler et al.)

XML encodings for following redactable signature algorithms:

* PSRSS
* GSRSS
* GLRSS

Take a look at the `WPProvider` class for the proper algorithm names and accumulator combinations.

Implementations of cryptographic accumulators:

* PSA accumulator (based on the trapdoor accumulator in "On Updatable Redactable Signatures" by Pöhls and Samelin)
* BP accumulator (based on "Collision-Free Accumulators and Fail-Stop Signature Schemes Without Trees" by Barić and
  Pfitzmann)

## Warning / Disclaimer
Do not use this code in Production!! It has not been peer-reviewed. Also, this repo will most likely be split into
two seperate repositories for the interfaces and implementations to make 3rd party implementations easier.

## How to use it

xmlrss can be used very similar to other cryptographic service providers in Java:

* Add the xmlrss library as a dependency for your project
* Register the `WPProvider`(`Security.addProvider(new WPProvider())`)
* Use redactable signatures via the `RedactableSignature` engine class

## How to compile it

This project uses gradle, which is pretty much self contained. Usually only a Java installation is required.
```
./gradlew build
```
